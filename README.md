Introduction
In this lab assignment, I am tasked with designing and testing various types of agents following the PEAS framework (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors). The agents include reflex agents, model-based agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, and learning agents. I will walk through the steps of building each agent, explaining the code associated with each step, and the expected output.
